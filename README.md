# COVI-LENDER

As the world recovers from COVID more and more people are starting to travel; however, not everyone remembers to plan their trip with the new COVID-19 quarentine restrictions.

## Our App

Our App is designed to help people make this planning easier. It takes in the country a person is leaving from, the country a person is traveling to, and their arrival date, and
uses this imformation to generate a calendar event. This calendar event is automatically set to the shortest durration a person would have to quarentine after travelling in the case
they are unvaccinated. 

### The Aim
The aim of this app is to help reduce conflicting planning of events after travel to allow for a person to have a better experience on their trip.

Our app is not designed to be the place where a user recieves completely accurate information about travel restrictions. Although, our team has tried our best to present the most
accurate information possible, there still remains a chance the information is inaccurate.
